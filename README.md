bb-collection-view
==================

This is a plugin for Backbone that will make it easy to display a collection of arbitrary
models.

Why?
====

Backbonejs (http://backbonejs.org) Collections will more often than not require an automatically updating view to reflect their current state. *bb-collection-view* provides a light-weight, unobtrusive, and flexible solution to this issue. It contains classes for a standard list and drop-down menu. The template for the standard list is overridable. When an item is clicked, these classes post a click event containing the model of the selected view. The drop-down menu additionally posts a change event with the new value of the menu.

These classes require almost zero code on the part of the developer. The most that you might want to do is provide a different item template function. This is as simple as passing an option. If you do desire extra functionality, simply extend these views to meet your requirements.

Dependencies
============

* jQuery or Zepto
* Underscorejs or Lodash
* Backbonejs

Usage
=====

The demos included in this package provide a pretty thorough use-case. Simply create a new view and assign a collection to it. Append the CollectionView's el to the document, and it will work out of the box automatically!
